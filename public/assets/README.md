Place your logo image files in this folder to reference them from the app.

Recommended paths:
- /assets/logo.png  -> use `/assets/logo.png` in Settings
- /assets/logo.svg  -> use `/assets/logo.svg` in Settings

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are served as static assets by the dev server.
- If you upload an image named `logo.png` here, enter `/assets/logo.png` into Settings -> Logo URL / Local Path.
